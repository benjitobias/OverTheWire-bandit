Challenge:

Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦ The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

Solution:
* ls <ssh key exists>
* cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26
* <logon shell is /usr/bin/showtext>
* cat /usr/bin/showtext
	* <basically prints something to screen by running 'more' on a file>
* ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@127.0.0.1
* <connects and exits after printing>
* <make screen as small as possible>
* <ssh again>
* <more stays in more process>
* v <enter visual editor>
* <esc>
* :e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
