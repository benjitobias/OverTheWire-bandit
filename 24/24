Challenge:

A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.

Solution:


* <write brute.py>
* python brute.py
* <exit every so often and check result>
	* ctrl+z
	* sort -u result
	* <check that its still running>
		* wc -l result
* fg

Flag:

Notes:
I originally wrote a python script to brute force using sockets but I had some issues with it.
I then wrote a bash script but it kept shitting itself, some error to do with forking (even when I removed the &)
Eventually I settled on an ugly hack using python to run bash commands.
