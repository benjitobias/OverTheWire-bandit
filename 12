Challenge:

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

Solution:

* mkdir /tmp/work
* cp data.txt /tmp/work
* cd /tmp/work
* xdd -r data.txt comp
* file comp
	* repeatedly unzip based on file type
