Challenge:

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.

Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…

Solution:

* cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit15
* openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:30001 -ign_eof
* <type level password from step 1>
