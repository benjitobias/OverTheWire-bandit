Challenge:

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy aroundâ€¦

Solution:

* ls /etc/cron.d
* cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24
* cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh
* <create bash sript hack.sh> 
* chmod +x hack.sh
* cp hack.sh /var/spool/bandit24/
* <wait until run - can check when it's been deleted>
* cat /tmp/hack
